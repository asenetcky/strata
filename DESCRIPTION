Description: Tools for building a framework for developers with access to only 
    the most basic automation tool-suite. The package is designed to help 
    developers organize their projects into a series of strata, and laminae 
    with options for logging, execution order, and error handling.
    Developers can use the code they already have, and get up and running 
    quickly.  There is only one automation target - main.R created
    in the project root directory.  This allows a strata-based project
    to play nicely, and more easily with packages like 
    'cronR' or 'taskscheduleR'. Configuration is handled by .toml files, 
    that can be tracked with source control and easily edited with
    the strata package, or by hand with a user's text editor of choice.
