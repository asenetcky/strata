The goal of strata is to provide a framework for workflow automation and
reproducible analyses for R users and teams who may not have access to
many modern automation tooling and/or are otherwise
resource-constrained. Strata aims to be simple and allow users to adopt
it with minimal changes to existing code and use whatever automation
they have access to. There is only one target file users will need to
automate, `main.R`, which will run through the entire project with the
settings they specified as they build their strata of code. Strata is
designed to get out of the users‚Äô way and play nice with packages like
`renv`, `cronR`, and `taskscheduleR`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install the latest CRAN release, just run:

``` r
install.packages("strata")
```

You can install the development version of strata from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("asenetcky/strata")
```

## ‚ú® Features

- Easily turn your R project into an automated one OR a one-click affair
- Easily view your project‚Äôs execution plan - no more hunting and
  pecking around to find out which script sources the next
- No more juggling multiple automated tasks - there is only a single
  automation target - `main.R` or `main()` function
- Simple and consistent built-in logging
- Manage code execution in `.toml` files
- Quick build options for rapid prototyping

## üéØ Target Audience

Who‚Äôs this for Who this isn‚Äôt for

## üöÄ Getting Started

`strata` provides users with framework for easier automation with the
tools they already have at hand. Users will want to make a folder for
their `strata` project. `strata` works all by itself but shines best
when bundled inside of an RStudio project folder and coupled with the
[`renv`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv) package.

### Build Strata

After loading and attaching the `strata` package users will want to
start hollowing out spaces for their code to live. Calling
`build_stratum()` and providing a name and path to your project folder
will add a ‚Äòstratum‚Äô to project, as well as a `main.R` script and a
`.strata.toml` file.

``` r
library(strata)

# Make a folder for your strata project
my_project_folder <- fs::dir_create(fs::file_temp())

# build_stratum creates a folder, a stratum,  where you can group together
# similar code into sub-folder/s called a lamina/ae

# pro tip: build_stratum invisibly returns the stratum path
stratum_path <-
  build_stratum(
    stratum_name = "project_setup",
    project_path = my_project_folder,
    order = 1
  )

# let's take a look at what was made

fs::dir_tree(my_project_folder, recurse = TRUE, all = TRUE)
#> /tmp/Rtmp6MCnt7/file46da856b62479
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.R
#> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ strata
#>     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .strata.toml
#>     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_setup
```

``` r

# let's take a look at that .toml file
view_toml(fs::path(my_project_folder, "strata", ".strata.toml"))
#> # A tibble: 1 √ó 4
#>   type   name          order created   
#>   <chr>  <chr>         <int> <date>    
#> 1 strata project_setup     1 2024-11-29
```

``` r

# our stratum is empty, let's change that in the next section
```

### Build Laminae

Next users will want to call `build_lamina()` with a name and path to
your stratum you created in the previous step. This creates a sub-folder
of your stratum where you R code will live, as well as a
`.laminae.toml`. It‚Äôs good to group like-code together inside of a
‚Äòlamina‚Äô. Users can have as many stratum as needed with as many laminae
and their associated R scripts that users deem necessary.

``` r
# remember we still have that stratum path from the previous section
# let's build some laminae you might see inside a stratum called 'project_setup'
# remember you can 1 or more R script inside of a lamina

# This could be a lamina that contains code that
# sets up your libraries for the project
build_lamina(
  stratum_path = stratum_path,
  lamina_name = "libraries",
  order = 1
)

# This could be a lamina that contains code that API keys and other credentials
# and/or makes use of the excellent `keyring` package
build_lamina(
  stratum_path = stratum_path,
  lamina_name = "authentication",
  order = 2
)

# This could be a lamina that contains code for setting up your
# database connections etc...
build_lamina(
  stratum_path = stratum_path,
  lamina_name = "connections",
  order = 3
)

# Don't worry if you forget to specify an order, strata will assign one for you!
# Always check that the order assigned is the order you want

fs::dir_tree(my_project_folder, recurse = TRUE, all = TRUE)
#> /tmp/Rtmp6MCnt7/file46da856b62479
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.R
#> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ strata
#>     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .strata.toml
#>     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_setup
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .laminae.toml
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authentication
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connections
#>         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libraries
```

``` r
view_toml(fs::path(stratum_path, ".laminae.toml"))
#> # A tibble: 3 √ó 5
#>   type    name           order skip_if_fail created   
#>   <chr>   <chr>          <int> <lgl>        <date>    
#> 1 laminae libraries          1 FALSE        2024-11-29
#> 2 laminae authentication     2 FALSE        2024-11-29
#> 3 laminae connections        3 FALSE        2024-11-29
```

### Adding R Scripts

Now that users have their stratum and laminae set up, they can begin
adding their R scripts to the laminae. Users can drag and drop their
existing code into the laminae folders or write their code directly in
the laminae.

``` r
# let's fill in the laminae with some placeholder code
auth_path <- fs::path(stratum_path, "authentication", "auth_code.R")
lib_path <- fs::path(stratum_path, "libraries", "lib_code.R")
conn_path <- fs::path(stratum_path, "connections", "conn_code.R")

authentication_code <- "print('I am your authentication setup code')"
libraries_code <- "print('I am your library setup code')"
connections_code <- "print('I am your connection setup code')"

purrr::walk(
  c(auth_path, lib_path, conn_path),
  \(r_file) fs::file_create(r_file)
)

purrr::walk2(
  c(auth_path, lib_path, conn_path),
  c(authentication_code, libraries_code, connections_code),
  \(r_file, code) cat(code, file = r_file, append = TRUE)
)
```

### Taking a Look

Adding all these folders and files is well and good, but how do users
keep track of it all? `strata` has you covered. This readme has
showcased a few already, but let‚Äôs recap and then look at the entire
execution plan.

``` r
# let's take a look at the project structure now
fs::dir_tree(my_project_folder, recurse = TRUE, all = TRUE)
#> /tmp/Rtmp6MCnt7/file46da856b62479
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.R
#> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ strata
#>     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .strata.toml
#>     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_setup
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .laminae.toml
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authentication
#>         ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth_code.R
#>         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connections
#>         ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conn_code.R
#>         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libraries
#>             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib_code.R
```

``` r

# Look at all those files now - let's grab the paths of only the .tomls
survey_tomls(my_project_folder)
#> /tmp/Rtmp6MCnt7/file46da856b62479/strata/.strata.toml
#> /tmp/Rtmp6MCnt7/file46da856b62479/strata/project_setup/.laminae.toml
```

Users can now `view_toml()` to see the contents of the `.toml` files or
edit/replace their contents as well.

The observability work-horse for most users will likely be
`survey_strata()`.

``` r
survey_strata(my_project_folder)
#> # A tibble: 3 √ó 7
#>   execution_order stratum_name  lamina_name script_name script_path skip_if_fail
#>             <int> <chr>         <chr>       <chr>       <fs::path>  <lgl>       
#> 1               1 project_setup libraries   lib_code    ‚Ä¶lib_code.R FALSE       
#> 2               2 project_setup authentica‚Ä¶ auth_code   ‚Ä¶uth_code.R FALSE       
#> 3               3 project_setup connections conn_code   ‚Ä¶onn_code.R FALSE       
#> # ‚Ñπ 1 more variable: created <date>
```

Users can run `survey_strata()` to get all the need-to-know about their
project. It is important to note that `survey_strata()` ‚Äúsees‚Äù the
project through the eyes of the `.toml` files, and *not* the actual file
structure, which might not reflect the true nature of the strata
project. If a stratum or lamina wasn‚Äôt built with `build_stratum()` or
`build_lamina()` or added by hand to the `.tomls` it will not show up in
the survey. This provides users with the flexibility to weave their
strata project in and out of other projects or test out new ideas
without affecting the execution plan of the project.

### Running the Project

`main.R` and its associated function `main()` is the entry point to your
project and the target that users will automate the execution of. When
executed `main()` will read those `.toml` files and begin sourcing the
pipelines in the order specified by the user/.toml files, and within a
stratum it will execute the laminae in the order specified by the user
and their specific .toml file. Within a lamina the scripts will be
sourced however the user‚Äôs operating system has ordered the scripts,
often alphabetically.

There are two ways for a uaer to ‚Äúrun‚Äù a project:

Users can source the `main.R` script that was auto-generated when
building a stratum.

``` r
source(fs::path(my_project_folder, "main.R"))
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6167] INFO: Strata started 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6170] INFO: Stratum: project_setup initialized 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6172] INFO: Lamina: libraries initialized 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6174] INFO: Executing: lib_code 
#> [1] "I am your library setup code"
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6179] INFO: Lamina: libraries finished 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6180] INFO: Lamina: authentication initialized 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6182] INFO: Executing: auth_code 
#> [1] "I am your authentication setup code"
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6185] INFO: Lamina: authentication finished 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6186] INFO: Lamina: connections initialized 
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6188] INFO: Executing: conn_code 
#> [1] "I am your connection setup code"
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6193] INFO: Strata finished - duration: 0.0028 seconds
```

Users can also just execute the `main()` function directly, all that is
needed is the path to the project. Users can also silence the logging
messages if they desire, however, any messages generated by the code in
the laminae will still be printed to the console.

``` r
main(my_project_folder, silent = TRUE)
#> [1] "I am your library setup code"
#> [1] "I am your authentication setup code"
#> [1] "I am your connection setup code"
```

That‚Äôs the core functionality of `strata`! Users build their project
with `strata` and then it stays out of their way.

## ‚ö° Going a Step Further

We have our strata project, now what?  
While it might be useful to organize all the disparate parts of your
project, and to turn it into a one-click affair, we can do better.

Users may not have access to the lastest and greatest automation tools
and orchestrators, but most users should have access to something like
windows task scheduler, cron jobs or similar. In fact there are already
two great packages that can help users automate their R scripts,
[`cronR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cronR) and
[`taskscheduleR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=taskscheduleR).

``` r
library(taskscheduleR)

## Run our project every thursday at 0700
taskscheduler_create(
  taskname = "strata", 
  rscript = fs::path(my_project_folder, "main.R"),
  schedule = "WEEKLY", 
  starttime = "07:00", 
  days = c('THR')
)
# TODO test this on windows ^^

# TODO throw up a cronR example as well
```

- rework this, grab pieces and move where appropriate - Now instead of
  juggling what to automate and when, or having to remember to which
  script sources which, users can automate the entire project with a
  single task, have consistent logging messages and use `strata` to have
  eyes on the entire project and its execution plan.

## üéÅ Additional Features

### Logging

`strata` provides basic, but consistent logging functions that are used
at run time, and are available for use inside of users‚Äô code if they
desire.

- Logging can be routed to stdout or stderr which can then be piped to
  wherever users want to store their logs.
- Logging format is consistent -
- \[TIMESTAMP\] is always 26 characters long, including square brackets
- the timestamp is always YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND.XXXX
- The log level follows the timestamp with a space and ends with a colon
- The message follows the log level and is separated by a space
- Logging is kept intentionally simple, but can still be parsed and
  analyzed

``` r

# The core logging function is log_message, and users can mold it to their needs
log_message(
  message = "This is a message",
  level = "INFO", # Use whatever "level" you want
  out_or_err = "OUT" # Send to stdout
)
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6526] INFO: This is a message
```

``` r

# Users can sending warnings
log_message(
  message = "This is a warning",
  level = "WARN",
  out_or_err = "ERR" # Send to stderr if user wants
)
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6533] WARN: This is a warning
```

``` r

# log_error() is a wrapper around log_message that sends messages to stderr
log_error("This is an error message")
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6542] ERROR: This is an error message
```

``` r

# log_total_time() is a simple function that  always prints the time
# difference in seconds

duration <- 
  log_total_time(
    begin = Sys.time(),
    end = Sys.time() + 999
  )

log_message(
  paste("This took", duration, "seconds"),
  level = "INFO",
  out_or_err = "OUT"
)
#> [2024-11-29 13:08:00.6582] INFO: This took 999 seconds
```
